Bhyve information contributed by Ed Maste @email{emaste at freebsd dot org}.

Bhyve (http://bhyve.org/) is the BSD Hypervisor. It is available on
FreeBSD 10.1 and other BSD operating-systems.

Download and uncompress the image:

    curl -o freebsd10.qcow2.xz \
         http://files.housegordon.org/pretest/v0.1/freebsd10.build-ready.qcow2.xz
    xz -d freebsd10.qcow2.xz

As of this writing (Dec. 2014), Bhyve in FreeBSD 10.1 cannot work with qcow2
images. In the future qcow2 will be supported directly.
Convert the qcow2 format to raw:

    qemu-img convert -O raw freebsd10.qcow2 freebsd10.raw

NOTE:
The 'qemu-img' version on FreeBSD 10.1 might be too old to convert qcow2 to raw.
Always verify the file format after conversion:

    $ file freebsd10*
    freebsd10.qcow2: QEMU QCOW Image (v3), 5368709120 bytes
    freebsd10.raw:   DOS/MBR boot sector

If the type of 'freebsd10.raw' is not "boot sector", bhyve will fail to load (it will
mis-detect the disk image, and deduce thatan installation CD is required).
If this is the case, either upgrade 'qemu' or convert the image on another machine with newer 'qemu'.

Load the "vmm.ko" driver:

    # kldload vmm.ko

Check `demsg` to ensure the machine is capable of running a virtual machine.
If the following error appears, the bhyve will not load:

    # dmesg
    ...
    vmx_init: processor does not support desired basic capabilities
    module_register_init: MOD_LOAD (vmm, 0xffffffff81a13d60, 0) error 22
    ...

Use the "vmrun.sh" script provided with FreeBSD 10.1 to start the guest VM:

    # sh/usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh \
        -m 384 \
        -d freebsd10.raw \
        pretest

NOTE:
1. 'bhyve' has no BIOS or similar; it relies on a userspace operating system loader to boot the system.
Special configuration  might be required for non-FreeBSD systems.
2. 'bhyve' uses virtio drivers by default. Some Guest VMs which do not work with virtio (e.g. GNU-Hurd) will fail to load.
